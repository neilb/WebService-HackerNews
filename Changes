Revision history for Perl module WebService::HackerNews

0.04 2014-11-10 NEILB
    - Forgot the blank lines between =item pod commands.

0.03 2014-10-13 NEILB
    - Improved the documentation for WebService::HackerNews, and added
      some basic doc for WebService::HackerNews::Item and
      WebService::HackerNews::User.

0.02 2014-10-10 NEILB
    - Added changed_items_and_users() method, which returns references
      to arrays of changed items and changed users. Changed since when,
      I don't know, and the official API doc doesn't say.
    - The SYNOPSIS was missing a line, which meant it wouldn't work.
    - I'd left "use Data::Dumper" in from while I was hacking.
