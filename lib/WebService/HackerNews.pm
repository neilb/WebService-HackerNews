=head1 NAME

WebService::HackerNews - interface to the official HackerNews API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use WebService::HackerNews;
 my $hn     = WebService::HackerNews->new;
 my @top100 = $hn->top_story_ids;
 my $item   = $hn->item( $top100[0] );
 my $user   = $hn->user($item->by);

 printf qq{"%s" by %s (karma: %d)\n},
        $item->title, $item->by, $user->karma;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an interface to the official
L<Hacker News API|https://github.com/HackerNews/API>.
This is very much a lash-up at the moment, and liable to change.
Feel free to hack on it and send me pull requests.

=head1 METHODS

As of version 0.02, this implements all of the functions
listed in the official documentation for the API.

=head2 top_story_ids

Returns a list of ids for the current top 100 stories.

 my @ids = $hn->top_story_ids;

You can then call C<item()> to get the details for specific items.

=head2 item($ID)

Takes an item id and returns an instance of L<WebService::HackerNews::Item>,
which has attributes named exactly the same as the properties listed in
the official doc.

 $item = $hn->item($id);
 printf "item %d has type %s\n", $item->id, $item->type;

=head2 user($ID)

Takes a user id and returns an instance of L<WebService::HackerNews::User>,
which has attributes named exactly the same as the
L<user properties|https://github.com/HackerNews/API#users>
listed in the official doc.

 $user = $hn->user($username);
 printf "user %s has %d karma\n", $user->id, $user->karma;

=head2 max_item_id

Returns the max item id.

=head2 changed_items_and_users

Returns two array references, which contain IDs for changed items
and usernames for changed users:

 use WebService::HackerNews 0.02;

 my $hn              = WebService::HackerNews->new;
 my ($items, $users) = $hn->changed_items_and_users;

 process_changed_items(@$items);
 process_changed_users(@$users);

The L<API documentation for this function|https://github.com/HackerNews/API#changed-items-and-profiles>
doesn't make clear "changed since when".

This method was added in version 0.02, so you should specify that as the
minimum version of the module, as above.
